<h2 class="section-heading">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>This project focuses on the analysis and optimization of energy efficiency in residential buildings using the mentioned dataset. The physical and design characteristics of buildings will be explored to understand their impact on heating load. For this purpose, models will be developed to predict the required heating load based on specific building characteristics. Additionally, the aim is to identify key attributes that influence the energy efficiency of buildings and provide practical recommendations for optimizing the design and energy management of residential buildings.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Description of Dataset</h2>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> This dataset was created by Angeliki Xifara and Athanasios Tsanas from the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom.</p>

<p>The "Energy Efficiency" dataset is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The "Energy Efficiency" dataset is commonly used in regression problems to predict energy efficiency in buildings.</p>

<p> <strong> Attribute Description:</strong> The "Energy Efficiency" dataset, which was collected to evaluate the energy performance of buildings, consists of 768 instances (m). Each building is represented by eight input attributes (independent variables) related to its design and geometry, and two output attributes (dependent variables).</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">Input Attributes (x):</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li>Relative Compactness: Relative compactness of the building</li>
    <li>Surface Area: Total surface area of the building </li>
    <li>Wall Area: Wall area of the building </li>
    <li>Roof Area: Roof area of the building </li>
    <li>Overall Height: Overall height of the building </li>
    <li>Orientation: Orientation of the building </li>
    <li>Glazing Area: Relative glazing area</li>
    <li>Glazing Area Distribution: Distribution of glazing area </li>
  </ul>
<blockquote class="blockquote">Output Attributes(y):</blockquote>
<ul> 
    <li>Heating Load: Heating load of the building</li>
    <li>Cooling Load: Cooling load of the building</li>
</ul>

<P>Before diving into the predictive modeling, an initial step is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). For this purpose, you can load the dataset into your working environment, such as Python with Pandas, and execute the following tasks:</P>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Calculate summary statistics, including mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles for each feature.</li>
    <li><strong>Graphs:</strong> Create visual representations like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the distributions and relationships among the features.</li>
    <li><strong>Correlations:</strong> Compute correlations between the features and wine quality to identify potential relationships.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Perform data cleaning as necessary, which may involve handling outliers or imputing missing values.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality Analysis:</strong> Examine the distribution of wine quality and search for patterns based on chemical characteristics.</li>
</ol>
