<p>This project aims to apply Machine Learning techniques to develop predictive models that can predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical attributes. To achieve this, visualization and exploratory analysis techniques will be explored to understand the distribution of the attributes and their impact on prediction. Additionally, the crucial role of data preprocessing and transformation in the modeling phase will be highlighted.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Description of Dataset</h2>

<p><strong>Source:</strong> This dataset was created by P. Cortez, A. Cerdeira, F. Almeida, T. Matos, and J. Reis. The "Wine Quality" dataset is available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.</p>

<p>The "Wine Quality" dataset is commonly used in classification and regression problems to predict wine quality. It was collected to evaluate the quality of white and red wines based on physicochemical attributes. The inputs were gathered through physicochemical tests, and the output is based on sensory data obtained from evaluations conducted by wine experts. Each expert rated the wine quality on a scale from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent).</p>

<p> <strong> Attribute Description:</strong>The "Wine Quality" dataset consists of instances of white and red wines, with a total of 11 numerical attributes. These attributes include characteristics such as acidity, sugar levels, sulfates, and alcohol content. The wine quality is represented by a categorical target variable. </p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">Input Attributes (x):</blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed acidity (Acidez fija): g/dm³ (float)</li>
    <li>Volatile acidity (Acidez volátil): g/dm³ (float)</li>
    <li>Citric acid (Ácido cítrico): g/dm³ (float)</li>
    <li>Residual sugar (Azúcar residual): g/dm³ (float)</li>
    <li>Chlorides (Cloruros): g/dm³ (float)</li>
    <li>Free sulfur dioxide (Dióxido de azufre libre): mg/dm³ (float)</li>
    <li>Total sulfur dioxide (Dióxido de azufre total): mg/dm³ (float)</li>
    <li>Density (Densidad): g/cm³ (float)</li>
    <li>pH: (float)</li>
    <li>Sulphates (Sulfatos): g/dm³ (float)</li>
    <li>Alcohol (Alcohol): % vol (float)</li>
</ul>
  
<blockquote class="blockquote">Output Attributes(y):</blockquote>
<ul> 
    <li>Wine Quality: It is evaluated on a discrete scale of 0 to 10, where a higher value indicates better quality</li>
</ul>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
